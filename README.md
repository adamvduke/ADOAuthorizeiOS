Purpose:
--------

ADOAuthorizeiOS is a static library designed to simplify going through the OAuth flow to get an access token. 
It borrows concepts from Ben Gottlieb's [Twitter-OAuth-iPhone](https://github.com/bengottlieb/Twitter-OAuth-iPhone).

Building/Running:
----------------

ADOAuthorizeiOS uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to satisfy it's dependencies. Add it to your Podfile as follows:

     pod 'ADOAuthorizeiOS', :git => 'https://github.com/adamvduke/ADOAuthorizeiOS.git'
